# iac-terramate-example

## Description

An example of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform and Ansible, enhanced by Terramate, to provision AWS infrastructure.

## Instructions

To quickly set up your workspace, [install Devbox](https://www.jetify.com/docs/devbox/installing_devbox/).
After that, run the `devbox shell` command and let the magic happen...

Now, you can list all the available predefined tasks with the `task` command.

Run `task init` first to install all the necessary prerequisites.

You can set up your environment variables in a `.env` file (e.g., for AWS CLI credentials), and DevBox will automatically apply them when starting the shell.

*Happy DevOps!*
